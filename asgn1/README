A lexer for Go lang

This lexer is implemented for the following tuple: 
Source Language : GOLANG
Implementation Language : C++
Target Language: MIPS

Firstly we wrote lexer.l which specifies the tokens along with their regular expressions.
Then we composed scanner.h which gives token number to each particular token.
Command 'flex lexer.l' produces lex.yy.c 
Then we wrote scanner.cpp to generate lexemes.
Then lex.yy.c file is used with scanner.cpp file to generate executable lexer, which is then executed with .go program as its argument to generate required output.

Run the lexer using following commands:

– cd asgn1
– make
– bin/lexer test/test1.go
