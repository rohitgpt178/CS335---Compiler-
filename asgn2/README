Three Address Code to Assembly Code Generator (Executable on SPIM Simuator)

This Code Generator is implemented for the following tuple: 
Source Language : GOLANG
Implementation Language : C++
Target Language: MIPS

Firstly we wrote tac.cpp which in itself consists of many function like getreg, setlocation, getlocation
for getting registers and their location when codegen.cpp is being executed. File codegen.cpp contains exact
commands for SPIM Simulator if that type of instruction is their in input file.

Make generates an executable which takes .ir file as input and produces an assembly code.

Run Code Generator using following commands

– cd asgn2
– make
– bin/codegen test/test1.ir
