Assignment - 4

3AC generator for the following tuple:

Source Language : GOLANG
Implementation Language : C++
Target Language: MIPS

In this assignment,we have implemented code which generates 3ac code from golang files. We have used emit based translation which means the translation occurs alongside parsing of input file. 

Along with the translation, we have implemented a symbol table which contains the variables and checks their scopes. The symbol table is implemented as a tree-like structure in which each node contains a pointer to parent node and a mapping of the variables in that scope to their entries (only types for now). 

Whenever a variable(or function) is declared, it is inserted in the symbol table of the present scope. Whenever a undeclared or out of scope variable(or function) is encountered, it outputs error.

The translated 3ac code is displayed on stdout.

Instructions to run:

– cd asgn4
– make
– bin/irgen test/test1.go
