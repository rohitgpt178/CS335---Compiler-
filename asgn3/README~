PARSER for the folloowing tuple:

Source Language : GOLANG
Implementation Language : C++
Target Language: MIPS

Firstly we wrote LALR grammer of GoLang in parserIR.y using lexemes in lexer.l as tokens and added action pertaining to each rule.
Then we used html.cpp, which creates a html file for the given program input. By running parserIR.y in bison parserIR.tab.h is created
and lexer.l through flex, lex.yy.c is created.

Now running html.cpp parserIR.tab.h lex.yy.c together an executable 'parserIR' is created in bin which given a GoLang program creates an html file.

Run the PARSER using following commands

– cd asgn3
– make
– bin/parser test/test1.go
- firefox test1.html

NOTE:
1. Every block except the last one ends with "};".
2. Block always contain ";" at least.
3. Variable declartions are using "var" in block and fields declarations are direct in struct.
4. Struct Declaration does not use define ":=".
5. Define is used for following assignment, a := f(b,c).
