PARSER - Go-cpp-mips compiler

check-----
1. method for structs and their calling (DONE)
2. defining structs in main and their fields and methods (DONE)
3. index check array (DONE)
4. declaring array at once - a = {3,6,7} (NOT IMPLEMENTED FOR NOW - maybe)
5. switch-case not working (TO REMOVE IMPLEMENTATION)

NOTE:
1. Every block except the last ends with "};".
2. If a block is empty, it still has a ';'.
3. Variable declartions are using "var" in block and fields declarations are direct in struct.
4. struct does not use define :=
5. define is used for a := f(b,c) (function and struct -> opposite)
